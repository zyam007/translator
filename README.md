Welcome to our Translator Chat!

Getting started:

1.  Fork and clone this repo.
2.  Run npm install.
3.  Create translator and translator-test databases.
4.  Run npm run seed to stock your chat with friends and conversations.
5.  Start the build process and your application with: npm run start-dev. If you're using Windows, you may need to execute npm run start-server and npm run build-watch separately (in their own terminal tabs).
6.  Navigate to localhost:8080
7.  Sign up and add friends to talk to.

Happy translating!
